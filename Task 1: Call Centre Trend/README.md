## My Insight <a class = 'anchor' id = 'my-insight'></a>

**Overall Performance:**

The call center handled a total of 5000 calls during the specified period. Of those, 72.92% were resolved, indicating a relatively high resolution rate.

The average time to answer a call was 67.52 seconds. More than 1 minute waiting for agent make customer uncomfortable and may be our customer can stop the call right now around 30 - 60 sec and change to another call service competitive. However this wait time make company get a lot of negative feedback in further. 

=> Now define a root problem which can improve time to answer a call ( agent, call system, customer,...). Improve faster response can help Customer Satisfaction Rate more higher in future and keep customer using our service (Now he average customer satisfaction rating was 3.40 out of 5)

**Agent Performance:**

Becky, Joe, and Martha demonstrated strong resolution rates, while Dan and Greg had slightly lower percentages.

The average speed of answer varied among agents. Joe had the fastest response time, while Dan and Greg were slightly slower.

The average handle time was 224 seconds, with a slight variation among agents. Jim and Joe demonstrated slightly faster handling times. However, there are individual customer satisfaction rate among agents, with Becky and Diane receiving higher ratings.

=> Dan and Greg is under productivity. Contact directly or meet face to face with Greg and Dan and define a problem with them and solve this problem in personel. Hold a call center agent meeting then present to them the positive result each of them achieve and encourage everyone more progress and more prductivity or may be give a employee who work hard in this month or this quarter an award for effort. In the future more training section is necessary
